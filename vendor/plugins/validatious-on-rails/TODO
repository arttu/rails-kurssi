== TODO

== High

* issue: Make messages not be bound to a specific validator, rather to a field. Tricky, but important.
* bug: validates_uniqueness_of/AJAX: Don't flash a failure message on a field that is already validated as valid upon submit. (Solution: a timer?)

== Medium

* feature: Make any validation be validated remotely if requested, i.e. :ajax => true/false. Add "Remote"-prefix to affected classes. **
* feature: Validator API: Custom validators (client-side + remote)
* feature: Form Input Helper API: Custom form helpers (non-"core helper" based)
* doc: Documentation of the above

== Low

* feature: Make Rails core validations basic options fully supported **
  * :on => :create|:save|:update (RemoteValidator)
  * :if/:unless => true|false (RemoteValidator)
* test: Tighten up the tests more.

== Not sure

* refactor: Consider refactor the validator calls im ModelValidations into the actual validator class. Would be a bit cleaner public interface?
* feature: Consider filter/masking of invalid input (e.g. validates_numericality_of).
* feature: validates_association
* feature: DataMapper, MongoMapper, ... support
